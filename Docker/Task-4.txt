Docker Copy Operations
The Nautilus DevOps team has some confidential data present on App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter. 
There is a container ubuntu_latest running on the same server. We received a request to copy some of the data from the docker host to the container. 
Below are more details about the task:


On App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter copy an encrypted file /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg from docker host to ubuntu_latest container (running on same server) 
in /opt/ location. Please do not try to modify this file in any way.




Verify the container
 docker ps

 copy the file 
 docker cp /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg ubuntu_latest:/opt/

 Verify the file is copied or not
 docker exec ubuntu_latest ls /opt/
